94676 Technology Lab 2: Connect and Network

In this task you begin to demonstrate your abilities in working with data, as well as working with other tools that help you do this across a group of people. In your group, you will connect two or more data sets with one and other, and use a variety of techniques to identify relationships (or a lack thereof) between the data sets. In doing so, you have the opportunity to demonstrate your ability to use code to manipulate and visualise data. You will also need to demonstrate how you use tools to collaborate, manage workload and tasks, and share ideas amongst your team. You will need to provide a diagram or illustration of your prototype of how these tools work together, as well as outline the pros and cons of working with each tool.
